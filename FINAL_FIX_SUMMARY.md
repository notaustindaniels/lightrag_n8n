# Final Fix Summary - Knowledge Graph Display Issue

## The Problem
The WebUI Knowledge Graph tab showed labels but no nodes, even though:
- Documents were successfully stored
- Graph data existed (195 nodes, 199 edges)
- Individual label queries worked

## The Solution
Added 4 lines to handle the wildcard `*` label in `lightrag_extended_api.py`:

```python
# Handle wildcard for all nodes
if label == "*":
    print("Wildcard label '*' requested - returning combined graph")
    label = None  # Treat as combined graph request
```

## Why This Works
The WebUI uses `label=*` as its initial query to show an overview of the graph. The original LightRAG code documents that `*` means "all nodes", but our extended API wasn't handling this special case.

## Files Changed
- `lightrag_extended_api.py` - Added wildcard handling (4 lines)

## To Deploy
1. Push `lightrag_extended_api.py` to master branch
2. After DigitalOcean redeploys, the WebUI Knowledge Graph should display nodes

## Testing
Run `test_wildcard_fix.py` to verify:
```bash
python test_wildcard_fix.py https://sea-turtle-app-6kjrs.ondigitalocean.app
```

This simple fix resolves the entire issue without breaking any existing functionality.
